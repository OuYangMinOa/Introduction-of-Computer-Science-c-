Write a function to determine if the input integer n is a prime number and if it is an additive prime number

Additive prime number: The sum of all digits is a prime number.

For example, n=133, 1+3+3=7 is a prime number, so n is an additive prime number. 

 

void function(int n, int& x, int&y)

if n is a prime number, x=1, otherwise x=0. 

if n is an additive prime number, y=1, otherwise y=0.
