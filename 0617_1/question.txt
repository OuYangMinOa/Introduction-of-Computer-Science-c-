Create a text file “tmp.txt” in the directory

Put in 10 integer numbers in the file

Write a C++ program to read in the numbers, assuming that you don’t know the number of data.

For now, you don’t need to check if the array size is large enough to store all data. 

Save the data in an array.

Find the median of the data.
